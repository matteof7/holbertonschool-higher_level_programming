# Python OOP - Abstract Classes, Interfaces, and Subclassing

## Introduction
Welcome to this set of exercises focused on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. You will explore abstract classes, interfaces, duck typing, and subclassing among other key OOP principles.

## Learning Objectives
- **Abstract Classes**: Define common interfaces while enforcing class completeness.
- **Interfaces & Duck Typing**: Ensure objects adhere to specific contracts.
- **Subclassing Standard Base Classes**: Extend built-in types for custom behavior.
- **Method Overriding**: Modify base class methods' behavior.
- **Multiple Inheritance**: Create complex class relationships.
- **Mixins**: Compose behavior across unrelated classes.
